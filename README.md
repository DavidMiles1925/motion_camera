# Motion Activated Camera

This project was inspired by a neighborhood cat that would come into our house through our pet door and make himself at home. We weren't sure when he would come in. We'd always just find him there. I built this motion-sensing camera and set it up next to my pet door so I could find out when the little guy was getting into the house.
